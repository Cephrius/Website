                <h2>	The proposed plan is to collect the trash around the campus, and with high-technology spaces and boilers, excess combustion temperatures aid in complete burning to reduce everything to a small quantity of ash that is easily thrown away (Hulley 36).</h2><br>
                <h2>    With the present-day air pollution control devices such as fabric filters, electrostatic precipitators, fabric filters and scrubbers, our company remove available dust and smoke that could be emitted to the school environment (Hulley 36).</h2><br>
                <h2>    A noticeably big economic benefit of our system is generation of heat energy which can be used to generate steam power and electricity as excess power the school can store and use under emergency situations (Hulley 36).</h2><br>
                <h2>	The students’ involvement will be to help create awareness about plastic waste management and help keep the school descent for everyone’s wellbeing (Lange 2).</h2><br>
                <h2>	Students and the school community will be mobilized into competition to collect and sell plastic wastes they generated (Lange 2).</h2><br>
                <h2>    Management of school campus waste in the United States is a daunting job, but necessary to maintain clean environment and healthy living for all students (Baum 8).</h2>
